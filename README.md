documentation soon, uses osu v1/v2 api to calculate pp from scores \
thank you to [cyperdark](https://github.com/cyperdark/osu-api-extended) and [maxohn](https://github.com/MaxOhn/rosu-pp) for their libraries 
## todo: (priority in order) 
- get a list of recent scores from user if they enter a user id
- figure out logins so my api key doesnt go over rate limit
- get errors working in api routes
- make it look nicer
